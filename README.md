**Change the MD5 hash** of any file by adding calculated bytes to the end. Ideal for series/movies blocked by hash.

## 🚀 What's New in v1.4.x

| ✅ **New** | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **.NET 8** | Migrated from .NET Framework 4.6 → .NET 8 (faster/lighter) |
| **Dark Mode** | Complete dark theme UI |
| **Spanish** | Full translation (buttons/menus/statuses) |
| **MD5 on Start** | No computation when adding (shows "waiting") → **much faster** |
| **Sequential** | Single-file processing (stable) |
| **Multi-language** | ES/EN + auto-detects system language |
| **Rounded ComboBox** | Language selector with dark style |
| **Multilingual Support** | Spanish and English available |
